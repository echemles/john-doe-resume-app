John Doe's Resume App
=====================

An assignment submission for crowded.com


### Tech Stack

* Node
* ReactJS
* Sass
* Webpack
* Express


### Running App

Install and run using the commands below:

```
npm install
npm run start
```

Once up and running on terminal you may test the app on different devices by going to the machine's IP Address on port 3000.


### Concept

Instead of a static HTML page, this project aims to create a rich app experience that reveals parts of the resume as they are needed. The layouts are mobile responsive. Although I wanted to take advantage of Bootstrap, creating a more customized design would fine-tune the experience further and create a unique experience.

The app was built with modularity & user experience as the main priorities.


### Compatibility

The site has been tested to work on Chrome & Safari with the following screen resolutions:

* 21" iMac
* 15" MacBook Pro
* iPad (Portait & Landscape)
* iPhone 6
* iPhone 6S
* iPhone 5
