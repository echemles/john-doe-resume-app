### Concept

Instead of a static HTML page, this project aims to create a rich app experience that reveals parts of the resume as they are requested by the user. The layouts are mobile responsive. Although I wanted to take advantage of Bootstrap, creating a more customized design would fine-tune the user experience.

The app was built with modularity & user experience as the main priorities.
